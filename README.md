SPOJ QUESTIONS LIST
List compiled by Anmol Deep (IT 2k14)
Beginners can start from the below questions on spoj and then move towards more
difficult problems. Please try to solve these questions yourself without referring to the
solution.

Before moving to the list, solve these basic adhoc questions for best results.

After solving the above questions you can solve below questions.
Contents:-
1.> ADHOC
2.> MATH
3.> Binary Search
4.> C++ STL & DATA STRUCTURES
5.> Sliding Window/Two Pointers
5.> DFS/BFS + Traversal on 2 D Grid
6.> DSU
7.> BACKTRACKING
About This:-
This is a very comprehensive list, solving this will get about 90% of your preparation done. Questions in
each set are sorted according to their difficulty, but
you can always try the next question if you get stuck. Everything from Math to DFS/BFS is very important, I
recommend solving all question in these topics as they
are mostly of easy or medium difficulty and will teach you a LOT of things. ADHOC is tougher compared to
the last set, but there are plenty of alternatives. Nevertheless, these will definitely improve implementation
skills. There are some basic questions on DSU. There is a section on backtracking which will cover
Josephus
algorithm.
The next set of questions will cover basic Dynamic Programming, MST, SCC, Shortest Path algorithms,
more problems on binary search, data structures, graph theory, dsu
AND string algorithms like KMP.
All the best!

CONTENTS
1.> Dynamic Programming
2.> Graph Algorithms(SCC+Topological Sort+Articulation Points+Lowest Common
Ancestor+DFS/BFS)
3.> MST & Dijkstra
4.> DSU
5.> KMP/String Algorithms
6.> Segment Tree/Binary Index Tree
7.> Greedy/Adhoc/Math/Binary Search
This list is somewhat less comprehensive as questions from such algorithms are hard to find and even
harder to solve. It is still a great collection for getting started
on SPOJ. The section in DP contains some classic techniques which need to be studied beforehand.
